This is for Tyler to filter his files. 

How to use: 

1. open command line in administrator mode: 
  -press Win+r, type in cmd, press ctrl+shift+enter, and press yes
  or 
  -search for command prompt and select run as administrator 

2. Next navigate to the location of the script (This may look different for you) 
  -type cd <file path> 
    -example: for me it would look like cd Users\Stephen\Documents\Projects\Tyler file thing\FileFilter\TextFilter

3. Put meta data file and data file into the input folder
4. Run the script
   -enter the command in you command prompt: python FileHandle.py <metadata text file name> <data text file name>
     -example:  python FileHandle.py meta1.txt input1.txt
5. Follow text prompts (dont missinput, theres like no error handling! :) )
6. A new text file called ouput.txt will show up in the output folder, this is the final product.
